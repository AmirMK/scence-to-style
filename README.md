# Scene-to-Style Web Application

This is a Streamlit app for furniture recommendations. Users can upload any type of video, and Gemini multimodal analysis evaluates it. If relevant, the app provides a range of furniture recommendations based on the style and architecture of the house. The Imagine model visualizes these recommendations, and Google Lens is used for users to search for items they like by image.

## Prerequisites

1. **GCP Account** - A GCP account with the image generation model activated. For more details on setup, refer to [this link]([https://cloud.google.com/](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/image/overview)).
2. **Admin Role** - The user running the setup script must have Admin privileges, as it will:
   - Create a service account
   - Assign required roles
   - Set up Cloud Run
4. **Organization Policy** - To make the application accessible outside of GCP, ensure the organization policy `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` allows `allUsers` access to the Cloud Run service.

## Quick Start

To set up and deploy the Scene-to-Style app, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Download the Setup Script

Open your GCP Cloud Shell and download the `set_up.sh` file:
   ```bash
   curl -L -o set_up.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmirMK/scence-to-style/main/set_up.sh
```

### Step 2: Run the Setup Script
In your Cloud Shell, make the script executable and run it as follows:

   ```bash
   chmod +x set_up.sh
  ./set_up.sh --project_id <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
```

## What the `set_up.sh` Script Does

The `set_up.sh` script automates the setup process by performing the following actions:

### Project and Bucket Setup
- Sets up the bucket as `<project_id>_scene_style`.
- Enables required GCP APIs for Cloud Storage, Vertex AI, Artifact Registry, and Cloud Run.

### File Downloads
- Creates a `scene_style` directory and downloads the necessary files (application code, Dockerfile, configurations) from this repository.

### Builds and Pushes Docker Image
- Builds a Docker image from the provided `Dockerfile`.
- Pushes the Docker image to Google Container Registry with the name `gcr.io/<project_id>/<project_id>-scene-style-img`.

### Service Account Creation and Role Assignment
- Creates a dedicated service account `<project_id>-scene-style-sa`.
- Assigns roles:
  - Vertex AI User (`roles/aiplatform.user`)
  - Cloud Storage Viewer and Creator (`roles/storage.objectViewer`, `roles/storage.objectCreator`)
  - Service Account Token Creator (`roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`).

### Cloud Run Deployment
- Deploys the application on Cloud Run in `us-central1`, with environment variables set for `PROJECT_ID`, `BUCKET_NAME`, and `LOCATION`.
- Configures the Cloud Run service to allow unauthenticated access for public availability.

### Assigns Cloud Run Invoker Role
- Grants public access to the application by adding the `roles/run.invoker` role to `allUsers`.

### Completion
- Outputs a success message once the setup is complete.

## Important Notes

- **Authentication**: By default, the application is configured to allow unauthenticated access. To restrict access, modify the Cloud Run settings in the script.
- **Environment Variables**: The script sets environment variables that are essential for the applicationâ€™s functionality.
